I further agree that my heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and/or anyone else claiming on my behalf, shall not institute any suit or action at law or otherwise against any of the Releasees, nor shall they initiate or assist the prosecution of any claim for damages or cause of action which I, my heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and/or anyone else claiming on my behalf may have by reason of injury to my person or property, or my death, arising from activities covered by this Agreement, WHETHER RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE AND/OR OTHER FAULT, EITHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, of any of Releasees, or from any other cause.
